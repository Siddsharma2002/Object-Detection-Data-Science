### README

To save time for now, this program is not a command line application. Any settings will have to modified in the code itself.
Towards the end of the file, there is a few variables marked under a "Settings" comment.
Once settings are specified, simply run this file to resize data.

### CAUTION
Use this application on a copy of the dataset in case any unforeseen issues occur.

### SETTINGS

dir - The target directory. The application will find all "Annotations" and "frame" directory combinations within this directory. Therefore, 
      this can be set to any level within the file system. Be careful with this, as any eligible files with be permanently affected within the directory.

target_width - The target width to resize to, this can be less than or greater than the current size.

target_height - The target height to resize to, this can be less than or greater than the current size.

display_visual - If this boolean value is set to true, the application will display an brief example of each resized image with its resized bounding box.
	         This operation will greatly slow down dataset rescaling, so use only if needed.

visual_display_length - This value will set how long visuals are displayed. This value is in milliseconds (1000 = 1 second).
			Keep in mind this application is not multithreaded, and the program will be stuck on this display step for as long
			as the visual is displayed.

### NOTES

This script was set-up to be potentially integrated into our other existing command_line tool.

### TO DO

Change to command-line tool.
Integrate this tool with other tool.
Add more file-validation before permanently modifying data.
Add warning about all applicable files in current directory will be affected, make user input button to continue.
